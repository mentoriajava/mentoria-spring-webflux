[{"id":"52cdef7c4bab8bd675297ded","name":"Farecast","description":"Airfare Prediction Service","overview":"<p>Farecast offers a unique service by providing its users with intelligent airfare predictions.  Founded in 2003, Farecast has since gained very healthy funding from several venture funds totaling $20.6 million.  Unlike other travel companies, Farecast predicts when a user should buy a ticket based upon 175 billion points of previous airfare data.  Its engine can currently predict whether airfare goes up or down up to a week into the future with a claimed success rate of 70-75%.  While Farecast has a lot of competition, they claim it is the only company which can predict future prices.</p>\n\n<p>The site has recently expanded to providing the best deals on hotel room as well. Results from travel search sites like ReserveTravel, Orbitz, and CheapTicket, are shown on a map with prices and other hotel information. Farecase gives deal finders an idea if a specific hotel is overpriced or a good deal by marking overpriced hotels blue and attractively-priced hotels red.</p>","email":"","phone":"","permalink":"farecast","category":"search","employees":26,"foundation":"2003-01-01","raisedMoney":2.06E+7,"updated":"+45164-10-17T18:43:20Z","presences":{"crunchbase":"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/farecast","homepage":"http://www.bing.com/travel","blog":null,"blogFeed":null,"twitter":"https://twitter.com/fareologist"},"tags":["travel"," airline"," airfare"," seattle"," smart-travel"," travel-search"],"aliases":[],"assets":[{"width":36,"height":150,"location":"assets/images/resized/0000/2650/2650v1-max-150x150.png"},{"width":48,"height":200,"location":"assets/images/resized/0000/2650/2650v1-max-250x250.png"},{"width":48,"height":200,"location":"assets/images/resized/0000/2650/2650v1-max-450x450.png"}],"products":[{"name":"Farecast","permalink":"farecast"},{"name":"Farecast Hotels","permalink":"farecast-hotels"}],"relationships":[{"past":false,"title":"VP of Finance & Administration","person":{"firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Farsje","permalink":"andy-farsje"}},{"past":false,"title":"Board","person":{"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Blachford","permalink":"erik-blachford"}},{"past":false,"title":"Board","person":{"firstName":"Moshe","lastName":"Mor","permalink":"moshe-mor"}},{"past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"McIlwain","permalink":"matt-mcilwain"}},{"past":false,"title":"PR Rep","person":{"firstName":"Anne Taylor","lastName":"Hartzell","permalink":"anne-taylor-hartzell"}},{"past":true,"title":"Founder","person":{"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Etzioni","permalink":"oren-etzioni"}},{"past":true,"title":"President and CEO","person":{"firstName":"Hugh","lastName":"Crean","permalink":"hugh-crean"}},{"past":true,"title":"VP Business Development","person":{"firstName":"Krista","lastName":"Pappas","permalink":"krista-pappas"}},{"past":true,"title":"VP, Engineering / Co -
