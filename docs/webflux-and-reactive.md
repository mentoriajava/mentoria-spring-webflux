# Webflux and Reactive Programming

To work with spring webflux, we will create a couple of endpoints to execute a basic CRUD of our company (all mocked up obviously), with a couple of validations, including the possibility of bulk submitting data and enabling multi format responses (JSON, XML and others).
This will serve as a base for everything, we will have some profile based approaches, some profiles to play around with annotation based and functional based.
