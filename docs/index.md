# Java Mentorship with Webflux and Reactive

Hello everyone, we are very excited with this new repo. Here we will focus on reactive programing using spring boot and for that we will be getting started with our friend Project Reactor and Spring Webflux.

We will be dividing our repo into a bunch of different topics and each topic will have its own branch. The base of the repo will have just documentation and the base for our other application features. We will try to use a bunch of different things to demonstrate how and why integrating with those technologies is a good thing.

Remember that there is no silver bullet when it comes to technology, so each piece of our stack is just a suggestion and each feature is also just a suggestion, with some tips and comments on each stuff.

But first, let's begin with our base.
